# Orburier
Orburier is an UE5 network predicted gameplay framework. This is the core project.

## NetworkPredictionPlugin
Even though the development of the new "NetworkPredictionPlugin"-system is not finished (& currently paused), it currently is in an useable state and can jump start this project since all the networking and prediction is taken care of. This system abstracts away the NetworkPredictionPlugin so that even if it would be abandoned it could be swapped out against an other.
